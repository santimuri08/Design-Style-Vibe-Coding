## Project: Humanist Modernism Design Implementation
**Total Screenshots:** 10  
**Purpose:** Document design progression, decisions, and final implementation

---

## 1. Desktop Homepage (1920px)
**Filename:** `01-desktop-homepage.png`

**What It Shows:**
Full homepage view at 1920px resolution displaying hero section, principle cards, and navigation. Text content constrained to 720px max-width with generous side margins (approximately 15% of viewport width).

**Why It Matters for Humanist Modernism:**
Demonstrates optimal reading experience on large screens. Despite wide viewport, content maintains comfortable 60-75 character line length. Wide margins create breathing room and prevent text from spanning entire width, which reduces comprehension.

**Design Principle Demonstrated:**
Content-first layout—reading experience prioritized over space utilization. Humanist Modernism serves the reader, not the grid.

## 2. Mobile View (375px)
**Filename:** `02-mobile-view.png`

**What It Shows:**
Homepage on iPhone SE (375px width) showing responsive layout, stacked navigation, and adjusted typography scale. Touch targets clearly visible and appropriately sized.

**Why It Matters for Humanist Modernism:**
Proves design maintains readability and warmth across devices. Body text remains 19px (doesn't shrink to 14-16px like typical mobile sites). Navigation stacks vertically for easy thumb access. All interactive elements meet 44×44px minimum touch target.

**Design Principle Demonstrated:**
Universal accessibility—design serves humans regardless of device. Humanist Modernism prioritizes comfort across contexts.

## 3. Typography Comparison (16px vs 19px)
**Filename:** `03-typography-comparison.png`

**What It Shows:**
Side-by-side comparison of same paragraph content at 16px (left) vs 19px (right) with identical line-height (1.75). Visual difference in reading comfort immediately apparent.

**Why It Matters for Humanist Modernism:**
Documents critical decision to use 19px over web standard 16px. Larger text isn't wasteful—it's essential for comfortable reading. Research shows 18-21px reduces eye strain and improves comprehension by 15-20%.

**Design Principle Demonstrated:**
Generous typography—Humanist Modernism rejects "minimum viable legibility" in favor of optimal reading comfort.

## 4. Color Palette Test (#000 vs #333)
**Filename:** `04-color-palette-test.png`

**What It Shows:**
Three color combinations tested: pure black on white (#000 on #FFF), mid-gray on light gray (#444 on #F5F5F5), and warm near-black on warm off-white (#333 on #FAFAFA). Includes contrast ratios from WebAIM checker.

**Why It Matters for Humanist Modernism:**
Demonstrates that warmth and accessibility aren't competing goals. #333 on #FAFAFA achieves 12.6:1 contrast (exceeds WCAG AAA 7:1 minimum) while feeling warmer and more human than pure black/white (21:1 but harsh).

**Design Principle Demonstrated:**
Warm neutrals—rejecting digital harshness while maintaining excellent accessibility. Humanist Modernism balances human comfort with technical standards.

## 5. Lighthouse Scores (95+ All Metrics)
**Filename:** `05-lighthouse-scores.png`

**What It Shows:**
Chrome DevTools Lighthouse audit results showing:
- Performance: 95
- Accessibility: 100
- Best Practices: 95
- SEO: 100

**Why It Matters for Humanist Modernism:**
Proves that human-centered design and technical excellence aren't separate goals. Perfect accessibility score (100) reflects core Humanist Modernism principle: design serves all humans, including those with disabilities.

**Design Principle Demonstrated:**
Universal accessibility—Humanist Modernism's commitment to serving diverse audiences backed by objective metrics.

## 6. Navigation Hover States
**Filename:** `06-navigation-hover-states.png`

**What It Shows:**
Navigation links in three states: default, hover (with soft cream background #E8DCC4), and focus (with 2px outline for keyboard users). Demonstrates accessible interaction design.

**Why It Matters for Humanist Modernism:**
Shows attention to interaction details. Hover states use soft, warm background (not harsh color change). Focus states visible for keyboard users (accessibility requirement). All states feel gentle and inviting, not aggressive.

**Design Principle Demonstrated:**
Understated interaction—clear feedback without visual aggression. Humanist Modernism guides users gently through interface.

---

## 7. Principle Cards Layout
**Filename:** `07-principle-cards.png`

**What It Shows:**
Six principle cards displaying Humanist Modernism core principles. Each card has generous padding (48px), soft corners (6px border-radius), subtle shadows, and warm accent border (4px left border in taupe #D4A574).

**Why It Matters for Humanist Modernism:**
Cards demonstrate warmth through accumulated details: soft shadows (not harsh), generous spacing (not cramped), warm accent colors (not bright), subtle hover effects (not jarring). Reading each card feels comfortable and inviting.

**Design Principle Demonstrated:**
Warm, inviting components—Humanist Modernism creates comfort through thoughtful details at every level.

## 8. Reference Comparison (My Site vs iA Writer)
**Filename:** `08-reference-comparison.png`

**What It Shows:**
Split-screen showing my project homepage (left) next to iA Writer interface (right). Similarities in typography scale, spacing, color warmth, and content-first layout clearly visible.

**Why It Matters for Humanist Modernism:**
Validates authentic implementation by comparing against established exemplar. Both use similar body text sizing (19-21px), generous line-height (1.7-1.8), warm colors, and single-column layouts. My implementation successfully captures iA Writer's human-centered philosophy.

**Design Principle Demonstrated:**
Authenticity to style—studied and successfully replicated core characteristics of established Humanist Modernism examples.

## 9. Mobile Navigation Responsive
**Filename:** `09-mobile-navigation.png`

**What It Shows:**
Navigation at three breakpoints: desktop (horizontal row), tablet (adjusted spacing), and mobile (vertical stack). All states maintain minimum 44×44px touch targets.

**Why It Matters for Humanist Modernism:**
Responsive design isn't just about "fitting"—it's about maintaining usability and comfort across contexts. Mobile navigation stacks vertically so thumb can easily reach all links. Touch targets enlarged from desktop (where precise cursor available) to mobile (where finger needs larger target).

**Design Principle Demonstrated:**
Context-appropriate design—Humanist Modernism adapts to human interaction patterns on each device.

---

## 10. Timeline Page Layout
**Filename:** `10-timeline-page.png`

**What It Shows:**
Timeline page displaying historical progression of Humanist Modernism from 1950s to present. Each time period in its own card with generous spacing. Subheadings every 2-3 paragraphs for scanability.

**Why It Matters for Humanist Modernism:**
Demonstrates how Humanist Modernism principles apply to content-heavy pages. Despite substantial information, page remains readable through generous spacing (1.5em paragraph spacing, 3-4em section spacing), frequent subheadings, and clear hierarchy.

**Design Principle Demonstrated:**
Information density + readability—proving that Humanist Modernism can present substantial content while maintaining comfort (influenced by Edward Tufte's work).
