### Color & Contrast Studies

#### 8. Warm Neutrals Comparison
**Source:** WebAIM Contrast Checker  
**File:** `color-contrast-comparison.png`

**What It Shows:**
Contrast ratio testing:
- #000 on #FFF: 21:1 (harsh, cold)
- #444 on #F5F5F5: 9.7:1 (better, still slightly cold)
- #333 on #FAFAFA: 12.6:1 (warm, accessible)

**What I Learned:**
You can achieve WCAG AAA compliance (7:1 minimum) while using warm colors. Pure black on pure white is harsh and digital-feeling. Slightly softened colors (#333 on #FAFAFA) maintain excellent accessibility while feeling more human and comfortable.

**How It Influenced My Design:**
- Used #333333 for all text (not #000000)
- Used #FAFAFA for backgrounds (not #FFFFFF)
- Achieved 12.6:1 contrast ratio (exceeds WCAG AAA)
- Site feels warm while remaining perfectly accessible

## Organizing Principles from Research

### Typography (Core Finding)
**Humanist typefaces improve readability through:**
- Varied stroke widths (calligraphic origins)
- Open apertures (reduces confusion between similar letters)
- Generous spacing (reduces eye strain)
- Screen-optimized rendering (maintains legibility at small sizes)

### Sizing (Research-Backed Standards)
- **Body text:** 18-21px (not 16px default)
- **Line-height:** 1.6-1.8 (not 1.5 default)
- **Line length:** 60-75 characters (720-800px at typical sizes)
- **Paragraph spacing:** 1.5em minimum

### Color (Warmth + Accessibility)
- **Warm neutrals maintain WCAG AAA:** #333 on #FAFAFA = 12.6:1 ratio
- **Pure black/white feels harsh:** Softened colors improve comfort
- **Muted accents over saturated:** Natural, sophisticated palette

### Layout (Content-First Philosophy)
- **Single-column for long-form:** Multi-column reduces comprehension
- **Wide margins:** 10-15% viewport width creates breathing room
- **Generous spacing:** Comfort over density
- **Clear hierarchy:** Serves navigation, not decoration
