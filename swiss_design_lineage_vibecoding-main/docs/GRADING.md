## 💡 Tips for Success

**Start with strongest pages**
- Homepage must be excellent
- One content page should be complete
- About page shows understanding

**Iterate until excellent**
- Don't accept "good enough" too early
- 2-3 iterations minimum per section
- Compare constantly to references

**Test early and often**
- Check mobile after each section
- Run Lighthouse multiple times
- Fix issues immediately

**Document as you go**
- Take screenshots during build
- Note decisions in real-time
- Don't wait until end

**Use time wisely**
- Focus on quality over quantity
- 3 excellent pages > 10 mediocre pages
- Stop reading, start building

## 🤔 Questions?

**"Do all pages need to be perfect?"**
No. Focus on homepage + one content page being excellent. Others can be good.

**"What if my Lighthouse score is 89?"**
That's fine. We're looking for 90+ but 85-89 is acceptable if design is strong.

**"How much documentation is enough?"**
Enough to show your process. 5-10 screenshots, a few notes, collaboration story page.

**"Can I change my style mid-project?"**
Only within first 2 days. After that, stick with your choice and iterate.

**"What if I run out of time?"**
Submit what you have. Partial credit for incomplete work if quality is there.
