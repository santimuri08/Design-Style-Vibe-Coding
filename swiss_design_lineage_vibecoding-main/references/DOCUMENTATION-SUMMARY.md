## Example: Using Documents with AI

### AI Collaboration Template

**Initial Context-Setting Prompt:**

```
I'm building a website for the Swiss Lineage Gallery project. I've been 
assigned [YOUR STYLE NAME]. I have three specification documents that 
define the requirements:

1. Universal Design System Specification (mandatory for all students)
2. [Your Style] Technical Specification (my style's implementation)
3. [Your Style] Historical Context (cultural and philosophical background)

I'll paste all three documents below. Please read them carefully and let 
me know you understand:
- The universal requirements (accessibility, performance, architecture)
- My style's specific design principles and visual language
- The historical context and relationship to Swiss Design

[Paste base-design-system-specification.md]
[Paste your-style-technical-specification.md]
[Paste your-style-history.md]

Do you understand the requirements and constraints?
```

**Follow-up Prompts:**

```
Based on the specifications, help me create:
1. A color palette that matches [Your Style] principles
2. A typography scale appropriate for [Your Style]
3. A grid system that reflects [Your Style] approach
4. Component designs that embody [Your Style] characteristics
```

```
Let's build the homepage hero section. According to my style specification,
it should:
- [Specific requirement from your spec]
- [Specific requirement from your spec]
- [Specific requirement from your spec]

While meeting these universal requirements:
- WCAG AA accessibility
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Performance optimized
```
