## The What - Core Principles

### 1. Grid-Based Layouts

**Philosophy:**
- Mathematical precision creates visual harmony
- Grid provides underlying structure for all design decisions
- Columns and modules create consistent rhythm
- Asymmetric balance within the grid system

**Technical Approach:**
- Column grids (typically 2, 3, 4, or 6 columns)
- Modular grids (squares or rectangles)
- Hierarchical grids (mixed column widths)
- Mathematical ratios (golden ratio, thirds)

**Benefits:**
- Consistency across multi-page documents
- Efficient production workflow
- Visual unity in complex information
- Flexibility within structure

### 2. Sans-Serif Typography

**Dominant Typefaces:**
- **Akzidenz-Grotesk** (1896) - Pre-Swiss workhorse
- **Helvetica** (1957) - Max Miedinger, Haas Type Foundry
- **Univers** (1957) - Adrian Frutiger
- **Folio** (1957)

**Typography Principles:**
- Clarity and legibility paramount
- Neutral, objective character
- Flush left, ragged right preferred (natural reading)
- Generous use of white space
- Hierarchical size relationships

**Avoided:**
- Serif typefaces (associated with tradition, decoration)
- Script and display fonts (subjective, expressive)
- Multiple typefaces (creates visual chaos)
- Excessive ornamentation

### 3. Objective Photography

**Photographic Style:**
- Documentary, unmanipulated images
- High contrast, sharp focus
- Cropping for compositional effect
- Integration with typography through grid

**Photo vs. Illustration:**
- Photography preferred for objectivity
- Illustrations used sparingly, geometrically
- No decorative or narrative imagery
- Subject matter clearly communicated

### 4. Asymmetric Composition

**Layout Principles:**
- Dynamic visual tension
- Weighted composition (not centered)
- Active use of negative space
- Visual path guides the eye

**vs. Traditional Symmetry:**
- Symmetry seen as static, boring
- Asymmetry creates movement and interest
- Balance through proportion, not mirror imaging

### 5. Minimal Color Palette

**Color Philosophy:**
- Limited palette (often black, white, one accent)
- Primary colors used systemically
- Color serves function, not decoration
- High contrast for legibility

**Common Palettes:**
- Black and white only
- Black, white, and red
- Black, white, and one primary color (blue, yellow)
- Grayscale with single accent

### 6. Emphasis on White Space

**Negative Space as Active Element:**
- White space frames and isolates information
- Creates rhythm and breathing room
- Guides visual hierarchy
- Communicates clarity and sophistication

**Technical Approach:**
- Generous margins
- Space between elements
- Unprinted areas as compositional tools

   - Top, bottom, left, right
   - Generous white space
   - Breathing room for content

3. **Establish Columns**
   - Number of columns (typically 2-6)
   - Column width calculation
   - Gutter width between columns

4. **Create Modules**
   - Horizontal divisions (rows)
   - Square or rectangular units
   - Baseline grid for typography

5. **Test Flexibility**
   - Layout variations within system
   - Asymmetric compositions
   - Column spanning options

**Mathematical Foundation:**
- Golden ratio (1:1.618)

3. **Set Alignment**
   - Flush left, ragged right (preferred)
   - Justified (only with proper hyphenation)
   - Never centered (except special cases)

4. **Determine Line Spacing**
   - Leading (line-height) 120-145% of font size
   - Consistent throughout document
   - Tighter for headings, looser for body

5. **Establish Line Length**
   - Optimal 45-75 characters per line
   - Wider for larger text
   - Narrower for columns

### Layout Process

**Swiss Design Workflow:**

   - Maintain consistency across pages

3. **Element Placement**
   - Position elements on grid
   - Use asymmetry for dynamism
   - Create clear visual path

4. **Refinement**
   - Adjust spacing and alignment
   - Check visual balance
   - Ensure clarity of communication

5. **Testing**
