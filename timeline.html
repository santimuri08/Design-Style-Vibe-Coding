                        <h3>Renaissance Typography</h3>
                        <p>Claude Garamond and other Renaissance type designers created letterforms based on humanist manuscripts. These typefaces featured varied stroke widths, calligraphic origins, and open counters that felt natural to read—establishing principles that would influence design for centuries.</p>
                        <p><strong>Key development:</strong> Transition from geometric capitals to readable minuscules based on handwriting.</p>

                        <h3>Modernist Foundations</h3>
                        <p>The Bauhaus and Swiss International Style emphasized clarity, grid systems, and function over decoration. While initially geometric and rigid, this movement established the importance of systematic thinking in design—principles humanist modernism would later soften with empathy.</p>
                        <p><strong>Key figures:</strong> Jan Tschichold, Josef Müller-Brockmann, Max Bill.</p>

                        <h3>Univers Typeface Released</h3>
                        <p>Adrian Frutiger designed Univers—one of the first systematic typeface families with multiple weights and widths. Unlike geometric sans-serifs, Univers maintained humanist proportions and optical corrections that improved legibility. It proved that systematic design could still prioritize human perception.</p>
                        <p><strong>Innovation:</strong> 21 weights designed as a unified system.</p>

                        <h3>Human Factors Research</h3>
                        <p>Scientific studies on readability began examining line length, type size, and spacing. Research proved that generous measures (60-75 characters per line), adequate leading (1.5-1.8 line-height), and appropriate contrast improved comprehension and reduced fatigue. Design decisions could now be evidence-based.</p>
                        <p><strong>Key findings:</strong> Optimal line length, the importance of whitespace, contrast ratios.</p>

                        <h3>Frutiger Typeface</h3>
                        <p>Designed for signage at Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, Frutiger proved that humanist forms excel in real-world wayfinding conditions. The typeface's open apertures and clear letterforms maintained legibility even at distance and in poor lighting—validating the humanist approach for functional design.</p>
                        <p><strong>Application:</strong> First major wayfinding system using humanist sans-serif.</p>

                        <h3>Edward Tufte's "The Visual Display of Quantitative Information"</h3>
                        <p>Tufte's groundbreaking book demonstrated how data visualization should prioritize clarity and truth over decoration. His principles—maximize data-ink ratio, respect readers' intelligence, show comparisons—became foundational to humanist information design. Beauty emerges from clarity, not embellishment.</p>
                        <p><strong>Principle:</strong> "Above all else show the data."</p>

                        <h3>Americans with Disabilities Act</h3>
                        <p>The ADA mandated accessible design in public spaces, spurring research into Universal Design principles. Designers began considering diverse audiences—people with low vision, motor impairments, cognitive differences—from the project's start rather than as an afterthought. Accessibility became a core humanist value.</p>
                        <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Legal requirement drove innovation in inclusive design.</p>

                        <h3>Robert Bringhurst's "The Elements of Typographic Style"</h3>
                        <p>Bringhurst's book became the definitive guide to typography, blending historical knowledge with practical principles. His humanist approach—"typography exists to honor content"—influenced a generation of designers to prioritize readability and respect for the reader over visual trends.</p>
                        <p><strong>Philosophy:</strong> Typography as a craft of service, not self-expression.</p>

                        <h3>Web Standards Movement</h3>
                        <p>The push for semantic HTML, CSS separation, and web accessibility standards (WCAG) brought humanist principles to digital design. Designers like Jeffrey Zeldman advocated for structure over presentation, progressive enhancement, and designing for diverse devices and abilities—digital manifestations of humanist values.</p>
                        <p><strong>Mantra:</strong> "Design for people, not browsers."</p>

                        <h3>iA Writer Launch</h3>
                        <p>Information Architects released iA Writer, a distraction-free writing app that embodied humanist modernism: generous typography (19px default), optimal line length, ample spacing, and focus on content over interface. The app proved that "less interface" could mean "more humanity."</p>
                        <p><strong>Design philosophy:</strong> Remove everything that doesn't serve the writer.</p>

                        <h3>Medium and Content-First Design</h3>
                        <p>Medium popularized humanist modernism on the web with comfortable reading widths, generous line-height, and typography that prioritized the reader. Their design system influenced countless sites to adopt similar principles, making readable web typography mainstream rather than exceptional.</p>
                        <p><strong>Legacy:</strong> Normalized generous whitespace and readability in web design.</p>

                        <h3>Variable Fonts & Modern Tools</h3>
                        <p>Variable font technology allows single files to contain multiple weights and widths, making humanist typefaces more practical for responsive design. Modern design tools (Figma, Sketch) made it easier to implement systematic spacing scales and test accessibility—bringing humanist principles into everyday workflows.</p>
                        <p><strong>Advancement:</strong> Technology enabling better implementation of humanist principles.</p>

                        <h3>AI-Assisted Design</h3>
                        <p>AI tools like Claude help designers implement humanist modernism by understanding principles and translating them into code. This collaboration between human judgment and AI execution makes sophisticated design more accessible—democratizing principles that were once the domain of specialists.</p>
                        <p><strong>Future:</strong> Technology amplifying human-centered design thinking.</p>
